 bm_532_reconquest:0 "The Last of the Romans"
 #bm_532_reconquest_desc:1 "It has been five decades since the loss of Italia. The lands, once undivided extensions of Rome, are now in the hands of pretenders claiming to be successors to the Roman Empire. These Goths and the rest of the barbarians rule each over their limited domains. Five years have passed since a new emperor ascended to the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire - Flavius Petrus Sabbatius Iustinianus I. In the short time he has ruled and with the help of his talented generals, Justinian has triumphed over his Sassanian rivals in the battle of Dara and revised Roman law in its entirety. Recently, Justinian faced and crushed a revolt against him; victorious, Justinian's ambitions are rekindled. The empire's goal and purpose are now clear - the reclamation of the entirety of Rome and the restoration of an era now regarded as the days of the good emperors. \n\n#bold Will the Romans triumph, earning their leaders the nickname "Last of the Romans"? Or will they truly be the last Romans?#!"
 bm_532_reconquest_desc:0 "It has been five decades since Roman power collapsed in the west. Once united under the banner of the Roman aquila, Western Europe is now divided among competing Germanic kingdoms, and the final Western Roman outposts in Soissons and Illyria had been subdued by their neighbors; only the Eastern Roman Empire stands as the last bastion of the glory of Rome. \n\nFive years have now passed since Flavius Petrus Sabbatius ascended to the purple as Imperator Iustinianus I. In the short time he has ruled over the empire from Constantinople, he revised Roman law in its entirety through the #italic Corpus Juris Civilis#!, quashed the Nika Riots, and repelled a Sassanid assault on his eastern border - particularly with the military genius of his general, Flavius Belisarius. \n\n#bold Iustinianus has long dreamed of restoring Roman rule to the west, and is now intent on dispatching Belisarius to lead the reconquest of the former Western Roman Empire. Will the aquila fly over Italia, Africa, and Hispania, or will it remain dormant in the east?"

 bookmark_reconquest_belisarius_desc:0 "From a young age, Belisarius has been present on the field of battle, from numerous campaigns against the Visigoths in Iberia to his great triumph over the Sassanian army in Dara. Belisarius proved to be a very capable soldier and commander; he crushed the Nika Riots, saving Justinian's rule while leading no more then 300 soldiers against a rabid crowd of 30,000. Justinian summoned Belisarius to the palace and shared his grand vision for conquest - the Roman Empire, restored to its full extent. Pursuant to this, Justinian has tasked Belisarius with leading an expedition to reclaim Africa from the Vandals. On his way out of the palace, a eunuch accompanied Belisarius, saying: \n\n#bold 'You are the last of the great commanders and your loyalty, clearly above question. However... what's left of the Western Empire is wild and unpredictable. A man might look about him and think, perhaps, that it is all rightfully his.'#!"

 bookmark_reconquest_justinian_desc:0 "Iustinianus was Emperor of the Roman Empire from 527 until his death in 565 AD. During his reign, he quelled the Nika Riots, secured his border with the Sassanid Empire, codified Roman law in the #italic Corpus Juris Civilis#!, oversaw construction of the current edifice of the Hagia Sophia, and ushered in the reconquest of North Africa, Italia, and part of Hispania. After his death, however, his successors failed to secure his gains, and by the dawn of the 8th century, the empire lost more than half of its territory to invaders. \n\n#bold Will you too usher the empire in a restoration of its territories and secure them for centuries to come, or will you and your successors eventually lose all that the empire fought and bled for?"
