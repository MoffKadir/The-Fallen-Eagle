 #bm_532_reconquest_desc:1 "It has been five decades since the loss of Italia. The lands, once undivided extensions of Rome, are now in the hands of pretenders claiming to be successors to the Roman Empire. These Goths and the rest of the barbarians rule each over their limited domains. Five years have passed since a new emperor ascended to the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire - Flavius Petrus Sabbatius Iustinianus I. In the short time he has ruled and with the help of his talented generals, Justinian has triumphed over his Sassanian rivals in the battle of Dara and revised Roman law in its entirety. Recently, Justinian faced and crushed a revolt against him; victorious, Justinian's ambitions are rekindled. The empire's goal and purpose are now clear - the reclamation of the entirety of Rome and the restoration of an era now regarded as the days of the good emperors. \n\n#bold Will the Romans triumph, earning their leaders the nickname "Last of the Romans"? Or will they truly be the last Romans?#!"

The Kingdom of the Franks, under the founder of the Merovingian Dynasty, Clovis I, remained restless after the downfall of Syagrius's regime. \n\n By the time of Clovis's death in 511 AD and the partition of the Frankish realm amongst themselves, the Alemanni tribes of Eastern Gaul and the Visigothic holdings in Aquitania fell under the Merovingian banner, and the Frankish people became firm adherents of Nicene Christianity after his conversion in 496. \n\n#bold Although the Kingdom of the Franks remains divided amongst Clovis's sons, it may not remain so if one of them is both ambitious and capable enough to pursue reunification . . ."
